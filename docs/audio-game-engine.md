# audio engine game design

## 1. Core World & Entities Module

### 1.1. Module Responsibility

The **Core World & Entities Module** serves as the fundamental layer of the game engine, responsible for managing the existence and fundamental properties of all objects within the simulated world. It implements the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** pattern. Its primary role is to provide the core data structures and interfaces for defining, organizing, and processing game objects. This module is the foundation upon which all other systems, such as physics, audio, and gameplay logic, are built. It maintains the single source of truth for the state of all entities in the world.

<hr>

### 1.2. Component Design & Interfaces

The module provides the following interfaces to define its internal components and their interactions:

#### **`Entity` Interface**

The `Entity` interface defines the most basic unit in the world. An entity is a unique identifier that acts as a container for components. It has no intrinsic behavior of its own; its "meaning" is derived entirely from the components attached to it.

```
interface Entity {
  id: string
  components: Component[]
}
```

* **`id` (string):** A unique identifier for the entity, ensuring it can be referenced across the entire game engine.
* **`components` (Component[]):** An array of `Component` objects, which define the entity's properties and data.

#### **`Component` Interface**

The `Component` interface is a simple data-only structure that represents a specific aspect or property of an entity. It holds the data that systems operate on.

```
interface Component {
  type: string
  properties: Map<string, any>
}
```

* **`type` (string):** A string identifier for the component's type (e.g., "TransformComponent", "AudioSourceComponent"). This allows systems to easily query for entities with specific components.
* **`properties` (Map<string, any>):** A key-value map holding the data for the component (e.g., a "TransformComponent" might have "position" and "rotation" properties here).

#### **`System` Interface**

The `System` interface defines a class of functionality that operates on entities that have a specific set of components. Systems contain the logic and behavior of the game.

```
interface System {
  update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number): void
}
```

* **`update(entities, deltaTime)`:** This method is called once per game loop iteration. It processes the relevant entities, potentially modifying their components or generating events based on its logic. `deltaTime` represents the time elapsed since the last update, essential for frame-rate-independent simulation.

#### **`Scene` Interface**

The `Scene` interface represents a complete, self-contained game world. It is the top-level container that holds all active entities and the systems that operate on them.

```
interface Scene {
  entities: Entity[]
  systems: System[]
}
```

* **`entities` (Entity[]):** An array of all entities currently active in the scene.
* **`systems` (System[]):** An array of all systems responsible for processing the entities in the scene. The `GameLoop` will iterate through these systems and call their `update` methods.

<hr>

### 1.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Core World & Entities Module** is the foundational layer and interacts with nearly every other module in the engine.

* **Spatial Definition Module:** The `TransformComponent` and `SpatialHierarchy` interfaces defined in the Spatial module are specific implementations of the generic `Component` interface from the Core module. The Core module provides the container for these spatial components.
* **Physics & Interaction Module:** The Physics module's systems, such as a `PhysicsSystem`, will query the scene for entities with a `PhysicsComponent` and a `TransformComponent` to perform collision detection and dynamics calculations. It generates `CollisionEvents` that are then published to the **Events & Communication Module**.
* **Audio System Module:** The Audio System will run an `AudioSystem` that queries the scene for entities with `AudioSourceComponent` and `AudioListenerComponent` to determine what sounds to play and how to spatialize them.
* **Events & Communication Module:** While the Core module doesn't contain the `EventBus` itself, it provides the entities and components that are the subjects of events. For example, when a `PhysicsSystem` detects a collision, it publishes a `CollisionEvent` that references the `Entity` objects involved.
* **Extensibility & Abstraction Module:** This module provides the `Prefab` and `ComponentDefinition` interfaces, which are used to build new entities and components. These blueprints are then used by the Core module to instantiate new `Entity` objects within a `Scene`.

<hr>

## 2. Spatial Definition Module

### 2.1. Module Responsibility

The **Spatial Definition Module** is responsible for defining and managing the spatial properties of all entities in the game world. It provides the essential data components for locating entities in 3D space, managing their orientation, and organizing them into hierarchical relationships. This module's primary function is to serve as the spatial backbone for other systems, enabling them to understand and manipulate the physical arrangement of the world's objects. Without this module, concepts like physics, audio spatialization, and rendering would not be possible.

<hr>

### 2.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module introduces two key interfaces that extend the generic `Component` interface from the **Core World & Entities Module**:

#### **`TransformComponent` Interface**

The **`TransformComponent`** defines an entity's position, rotation, and scale in 3D space. It is one of the most fundamental components in the engine, providing the absolute or relative spatial data for an entity.

```
interface TransformComponent extends Component {
  position: Vec3
  rotation: Quat
  scale: Vec3
}
```

* **`position` (Vec3):** A vector representing the entity's location in 3D space ($x, y, z$).
* **`rotation` (Quat):** A quaternion representing the entity's orientation. Quaternions are used to avoid issues like gimbal lock that can occur with Euler angles.
* **`scale` (Vec3):** A vector representing the entity's size along each axis.

#### **`SpatialHierarchy` Interface**

The **`SpatialHierarchy`** interface defines the parent-child relationships between entities, allowing for nested transformations. This is crucial for grouping entities (e.g., a table attached to a room) and having their transformations cascade from their parent.

```
interface SpatialHierarchy {
  parent?: Entity
  children: Entity[]
}
```

* **`parent` (Entity?):** An optional reference to the entity's parent. If a parent exists, the entity's `TransformComponent` values are relative to the parent's transformation.
* **`children` (Entity[]):** An array of entities that are children of this entity.

<hr>

### 2.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Spatial Definition Module** is a critical intermediate layer in the engine's conceptual stack, linking the foundational entities to the functional systems.

* **World & Core Entities Module:** This module's interfaces (`TransformComponent`, `SpatialHierarchy`) are implementations of the generic `Component` interface, making it a foundational layer built directly on the ECS model. The core `Scene` object will contain entities with these components.
* **Physics & Interaction Module:** The physics system relies heavily on the **`TransformComponent`** to determine the position and orientation of objects for collision detection and response. When a physics event (like a collision) occurs, the physics system updates the `position` and `rotation` of the affected entities' `TransformComponent`.
* **Audio System Module:** The audio system's spatialization engine uses the `position` and `orientation` data from the **`TransformComponent`** of both the `AudioListenerComponent` (the player's perspective) and all `AudioSourceComponent`s. This data is essential for calculating distance, direction, and occlusion to create a realistic 3D soundscape.
* **Player & Interaction Module:** The player entity will possess a **`TransformComponent`** and a **`SpatialHierarchy`** so that it can be positioned and oriented in the world, and other entities (like a flashlight held by the player) can be attached to it. The input system will directly manipulate the player's `TransformComponent` to handle movement.

<hr>

## 3. Physics & Interaction Module

### 3.1. Module Responsibility

The **Physics & Interaction Module** simulates the physical behavior of entities within the world. Its primary responsibility is to provide the logic for **collision detection**, **material properties**, and **triggers**, allowing entities to react to physical contact. This module processes entities with specific components to calculate forces, update positions, and, most critically for this engine, generate **physical events** that serve as the foundation for the audio feedback loop. It's the layer that translates an entity's spatial properties into tangible, interactive events.

<hr>

### 3.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module introduces two key interfaces: a component for defining physical properties and an event for communicating collision data.

#### **`PhysicsComponent` Interface**

The **`PhysicsComponent`** extends the base `Component` interface and defines the physical characteristics of an entity, such as its mass, material type, and whether it's a trigger volume. A physics system will query for entities that have this component to include them in its simulation.

```
interface PhysicsComponent extends Component {
  mass: number
  material: string
  isTrigger: boolean
}
```

* **`mass` (number):** A numerical value representing the entity's mass, used in dynamics calculations (e.g., how far an object is pushed by a force).
* **`material` (string):** A string identifier for the surface type (e.g., "wood", "metal", "glass"). This is a crucial link to the audio system, as the **Audio System Module** will use this information to determine the correct sound to play on a collision event.
* **`isTrigger` (boolean):** A flag that, when true, indicates the entity should not physically block other objects but should still generate an event when another object enters its volume (e.g., a room boundary).

#### **`CollisionEvent` Interface**

The **`CollisionEvent`** is a specialized event generated by the physics system. It is published to the **Events & Communication Module** to inform other systems that a physical interaction has occurred.

```
interface CollisionEvent {
  entityA: Entity
  entityB: Entity
  contactPoint: Vec3
}
```

* **`entityA` (Entity):** The first entity involved in the collision.
* **`entityB` (Entity):** The second entity involved in the collision.
* **`contactPoint` (Vec3):** The location in 3D space where the collision occurred. This point is essential for spatializing the resulting audio event.

<hr>

### 3.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Physics & Interaction Module** is a critical producer of information for the rest of the engine, especially for the core audio experience.

* **Spatial Definition Module:** The physics system directly uses the `TransformComponent` (from the **Spatial Definition Module**) of all entities to calculate collisions. It will update the `position` and `rotation` properties on the `TransformComponent` to reflect the results of physics simulation.
* **Events & Communication Module:** This is the primary output channel for the physics module. Once a collision is detected, a `CollisionEvent` is created and published to the `EventBus`. This decoupled communication ensures that the audio system and other gameplay systems can react to physics events without direct dependencies.
* **Audio System Module:** This is the main consumer of the physics module's output. The **Audio System Module** subscribes to `CollisionEvent`s. Upon receiving a `CollisionEvent`, it can retrieve the `material` property from the involved entities' `PhysicsComponent`s and use the `contactPoint` to play an appropriate, spatially accurate sound. For example, a collision between a `PhysicsComponent` with "wood" material and one with "metal" material would trigger a distinct "wood-on-metal" sound.

<hr>

## 4. Audio System Module

### 4.1. Module Responsibility

The **Audio System Module** is the engine's core sound-rendering component. Its main responsibility is to translate abstract audio requests and spatial data into audible sound. It manages the **Listener** (the player's auditory perspective), renders **Audio Sources** in 3D space, applies **spatialization** and environmental effects like **room acoustics**, and handles the real-time playing, stopping, and modification of sounds. This module is the direct consumer of events and spatial data from other systems, and it is the key component that provides the auditory feedback essential for gameplay.

<hr>

### 4.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module defines the components that represent sound in the game world and the interfaces that define how they are perceived.

#### **`AudioListenerComponent` Interface**

The **`AudioListenerComponent`** represents the point in space from which all sounds are perceived. An entity with this component (typically the player) acts as the "ear" in the world. Its position and orientation are critical for all spatialized audio.

```
interface AudioListenerComponent extends Component {
  orientation: Quat
  position: Vec3
}
```

* **`orientation` (Quat):** The direction the listener is facing, used for directional sound perception.
* **`position` (Vec3):** The location of the listener in 3D space.

#### **`AudioSourceComponent` Interface**

The **`AudioSourceComponent`** is responsible for emitting a specific sound into the world. It links an entity to a sound asset and contains properties that control how the sound is played.

```
interface AudioSourceComponent extends Component {
  soundAsset: string
  loop: boolean
  volume: number
  spatialized: boolean
}
```

* **`soundAsset` (string):** An identifier for the sound file to be played, referencing an asset managed by the **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module**.
* **`loop` (boolean):** A flag to determine if the sound should repeat indefinitely.
* **`volume` (number):** The base volume of the sound source, before spatialization effects.
* **`spatialized` (boolean):** A flag indicating whether the sound should be processed through the 3D spatialization engine or played as a 2D, non-spatial sound (e.g., UI sounds).

<hr>

### 4.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Audio System Module** is a hub of interaction, consuming data and events from multiple sources to create a cohesive soundscape.

* **Spatial Definition Module:** The `AudioSystem` directly queries the **`TransformComponent`** of both the entity with the `AudioListenerComponent` and all entities with an `AudioSourceComponent`. It uses the `position` and `rotation` data to calculate distance, direction, and apply a 3D audio rendering algorithm.
* **Physics & Interaction Module:** The audio system subscribes to the `EventBus` for `CollisionEvent`s. Upon receiving one, it uses the `material` property from the `PhysicsComponent` of the involved entities and the `contactPoint` from the event to play an appropriate collision sound. This is a primary mechanism for providing real-time, physics-based audio feedback.
* **Events & Communication Module:** The module constantly listens to the `EventBus` for a variety of event types. For example, a `GameplayEvent` like "doorOpened" or "objectDropped" could trigger a request for a new `AudioSourceComponent` to be created and a sound to be played.
* **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module:** The `soundAsset` string in the `AudioSourceComponent` is a reference to an asset managed by this module. The `AudioSystem` will use this reference to load the correct sound file from disk and play it.
* **Environment & Rooms Module:** This module's `Room` and `AcousticProfile` interfaces provide crucial data to the audio system. The audio engine uses the listener's position to determine which `Room` it is in, then applies that room's `reverb`, `absorption`, and `reflections` to all sounds for a realistic acoustic environment.

<hr>

## 5. Events & Communication Module

### 5.1. Module Responsibility

The **Events & Communication Module** provides a decoupled, publish-subscribe system for communication between different parts of the game engine. Its core responsibility is to facilitate a clean flow of information, ensuring that one system can trigger an action or provide data to another without needing a direct reference to it. This design pattern prevents tight coupling, making the engine more modular, scalable, and easier to debug. It is the central nervous system of the engine, translating high-level actions and data changes into notifications that interested systems can act upon.

<hr>

### 5.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module is defined by the following two core interfaces:

#### **`Event` Interface**

The **`Event`** interface is a generic data structure that encapsulates a message to be sent through the system. Any information that needs to be communicated between modules should be formatted as an `Event`.

```
interface Event {
  type: string
  payload: any
}
```

* **`type` (string):** A string identifier for the event (e.g., "collision", "doorOpened", "soundPlayRequest"). This allows subscribers to filter for the specific events they are interested in.
* **`payload` (any):** The data associated with the event. The payload's structure is specific to the event type. For example, a `CollisionEvent` payload would contain references to the entities involved, while a `GameplayEvent` payload might contain a string indicating the specific action.

#### **`EventBus` Interface**

The **`EventBus`** is the central hub for the event system. It provides the methods for systems to send and receive events. The `EventBus` manages the list of subscribers and their corresponding event types, ensuring events are delivered to the correct handlers.

```
interface EventBus {
  publish(event: Event): void
  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: (event: Event) => void): void
}
```

* **`publish(event)`:** A method used by systems to broadcast an event to all subscribers. The system that calls this method is the "publisher."
* **`subscribe(eventType, handler)`:** A method used by systems to register interest in a specific type of event. The `handler` is a callback function that will be executed whenever an event of the specified `eventType` is published. The system that calls this method is a "subscriber."

<hr>

### 5.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Events & Communication Module** acts as the glue between all other modules, enabling them to work together cohesively.

* **Physics & Interaction Module:** The physics system is a major **publisher** of events. When a collision or a trigger event occurs, it creates and publishes a `CollisionEvent` to the `EventBus`.
* **Audio System Module:** The audio system is a major **subscriber** to events. It will subscribe to events like `CollisionEvent` and various `GameplayEvent`s to trigger the playing of sounds. For example, it might subscribe to an "objectDropped" event to play a dropping sound effect. The audio system itself can also **publish** events, such as a "soundFinishedPlaying" event, which other systems could use.
* **Player & Interaction Module:** The player input system will translate player actions (e.g., pressing a key to open a door) into a `GameplayEvent` and publish it to the `EventBus`. This allows the **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module** to be notified that a sound associated with opening a door needs to be loaded and the **Audio System Module** to be notified to play it.
* **Runtime & Flow Module:** The `GameLoop` is responsible for driving the engine's update cycle. While it does not directly use the `EventBus`, the systems it updates (like the `PhysicsSystem`) will publish events during their update cycle. The `EventBus` must be managed to process all published events before the next frame begins to ensure synchronization.

<hr>

## 6. Resource & Asset Abstraction Module

### 6.1. Module Responsibility

The **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module** is responsible for managing all external files and data used by the game engine, such as sound files, scene layouts, and other metadata. It acts as a central repository, providing a clean, consistent interface for other systems to access and load assets without needing to know their underlying file paths or formats. This module ensures that resources are efficiently loaded, cached, and managed throughout the engine's lifecycle, decoupling the engine's logic from the raw asset data. It's the engine's library and curator, making sure the right content is available when needed.

<hr>

### 6.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module is defined by the following key interfaces, which represent the abstract concept of a game asset:

#### **`Asset` Interface**

The **`Asset`** interface is the base type for all resources managed by the engine. It provides a common structure for identification and location.

```
interface Asset {
  id: string
  type: string
  path: string
}
```

* **`id` (string):** A unique, engine-wide identifier for the asset (e.g., "door_\_creak\_sfx\_01"). This ID is used by other systems to request a specific resource.
* **`type` (string):** A string that categorizes the asset (e.g., "audio", "scene").
* **`path` (string):** The file system path to the asset's data on disk.

#### **`AudioAsset` Interface**

The **`AudioAsset`** interface is a specialized `Asset` that specifically handles audio files. It includes additional metadata relevant to the Audio System.

```
interface AudioAsset extends Asset {
  category: string
}
```

* **`category` (string):** A classification for the sound (e.g., "SFX", "music", "ambience", "UI"). This can be used by the Audio System for volume control, mixing, or filtering.

#### **`SceneDefinition` Interface**

The **`SceneDefinition`** interface is a high-level data structure that describes an entire scene or level. It contains a list of entities and prefabs that need to be instantiated to build the world.

```
interface SceneDefinition {
  entities: Entity[]
  prefabs: Prefab[]
}
```

* **`entities` (Entity[]):** A list of entities to be loaded and placed in the scene.
* **`prefabs` (Prefab[]):** A list of prefab blueprints that can be instantiated dynamically within the scene.

<hr>

### 6.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module** provides a fundamental service to other engine components, enabling them to populate the world with content.

* **Audio System Module:** The Audio System uses the `id` from an `AudioSourceComponent` to query the Resource & Asset Abstraction Module for the corresponding `AudioAsset`. It then uses the `path` from the `AudioAsset` to load the actual sound file into memory for playback.
* **Core World & Entities Module:** The Core World & Entities Module relies on this module to load and build scenes. The engine's `GameLoop` can receive a request to load a new scene; it would then use the `path` from a `SceneDefinition` asset to retrieve the entire scene's data, which it would then use to instantiate all the entities and prefabs for that level.
* **Extensibility & Abstraction Module:** The `Prefab` interface from the Extensibility & Abstraction Module is closely linked here. The `SceneDefinition` uses prefabs as its building blocks, and the Resource & Asset Abstraction Module would be responsible for loading and parsing the raw prefab data from disk.
* **Events & Communication Module:** While not a direct publisher or subscriber, this module can receive requests via events (e.g., "load_\_asset") and then publish an event (e.g., "asset_\_loaded") once the operation is complete.

<hr>

## 7. Environment & Rooms Module

### 7.1. Module Responsibility

The **Environment & Rooms Module** defines and manages the acoustic properties of different spaces within the game world. Its core responsibility is to translate spatial boundaries into distinct acoustic profiles, such as reverb, absorption, and reflections. This module provides a mechanism to group entities into specific zones (e.g., a bedroom, a hallway) and gives the **Audio System Module** the data needed to apply realistic environmental sound effects. It is the layer that makes the game world sound like a physical space, where sound behaves differently based on the environment.

<hr>

### 7.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module is defined by the following interfaces, which represent the conceptual components of an acoustic space:

#### **`Room` Interface**

The **`Room`** interface represents a defined spatial area with unique acoustic properties. These boundaries can be of any shape and are used to determine which acoustic profile should be applied to the listener and sound sources within them.

```
interface Room {
  id: string
  bounds: BoundingVolume
  acousticProfile: AcousticProfile
}
```

* **`id` (string):** A unique identifier for the room (e.g., "bedroom_\_01", "hallway_\_03").
* **`bounds` (BoundingVolume):** A geometric shape (e.g., a box, a sphere) that defines the physical boundaries of the room.
* **`acousticProfile` (AcousticProfile):** A reference to the specific acoustic properties that should be applied to sounds originating from or listened to within this volume.

#### **`AcousticProfile` Interface**

The **`AcousticProfile`** interface encapsulates the specific parameters that define the acoustic characteristics of a space, such as its reverb and absorption properties.

```
interface AcousticProfile {
  reverb: number
  absorption: number
  reflections: number
}
```

* **`reverb` (number):** The amount of reverberation, or echo, in the room. This simulates sound bouncing off surfaces.
* **`absorption` (number):** A value representing how much sound is absorbed by the surfaces in the room (e.g., carpets absorb more than concrete).
* **`reflections` (number):** A value representing the number and intensity of distinct sound reflections, simulating more complex echoes.

<hr>

### 7.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Environment & Rooms Module** is a key data provider for the audio system, linking spatial location to aural experience.

* **Audio System Module:** The Audio System is the primary consumer of this module's data. It will perform a spatial query to determine which `Room` the `AudioListenerComponent` (the player) is currently in. Once the room is identified, the audio system uses the `acousticProfile` data to apply real-time reverb, absorption, and reflection effects to all spatialized sound sources, making the soundscape sound physically correct for that space.
* **Spatial Definition Module:** This module relies on the **`TransformComponent`** from the **Spatial Definition Module**. The `AudioSystem` uses the listener's `position` to check if it's inside a `Room`'s `bounds`.
* **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module:** The `Room` data and its `acousticProfile`s would be loaded as part of a `SceneDefinition` managed by the **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module**. The module would read this data from a file and populate the `Room` objects at scene load time.

<hr>

## 8. Runtime & Flow Module

### 8.1. Module Responsibility

The **Runtime & Flow Module** is the core loop that drives the entire game engine. Its primary responsibility is to manage the flow of time and synchronize the execution of all other systems. It provides the **update loop**, a continuous cycle that processes physics, events, audio, and gameplay logic in a synchronized manner. This module ensures that the game world progresses consistently, independent of the user's hardware performance, by providing a crucial `deltaTime` value to all systems. It is the engine's heartbeat, dictating the pace and order of operations.

<hr>

### 8.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module defines two core interfaces that govern the engine's progression:

#### **`Time` Interface**

The **`Time`** interface is a data object that provides information about the current state of the game clock. This is the single source of truth for time-related data across all systems.

```
interface Time {
  deltaTime: number
  currentTime: number
}
```

* **`deltaTime` (number):** The time in seconds that has elapsed since the last update frame. This value is critical for making all simulations (e.g., physics, movement) frame-rate independent.
* **`currentTime` (number):** The total time in seconds that the game has been running.

#### **`GameLoop` Interface**

The **`GameLoop`** interface defines the main update function that drives the engine. This is the central function that is called repeatedly to advance the game state.

```
interface GameLoop {
  update(time: Time): void
}
```

* **`update(time)`:** This is the main method of the game loop. During each call, it iterates through all registered systems and calls their `update` methods, passing the `Time` object so they can perform their calculations.

<hr>

### 8.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Runtime & Flow Module** is the conductor of the engine's orchestra, orchestrating all other systems.

* **All Systems:** The **`GameLoop`** is responsible for calling the `update` method on every `System` registered in the `Scene` (from the **Core World & Entities Module**). This ensures that physics, audio, and other game logic are processed in a predictable order.
* **Physics & Interaction Module:** The `PhysicsSystem` receives `deltaTime` from the `Time` object and uses it to perform its physics calculations (e.g., updating an entity's position based on its velocity and forces).
* **Audio System Module:** The `AudioSystem` may also use `deltaTime` to update things like sound effects that have a time component (e.g., a sound that fades in over a certain duration).
* **Events & Communication Module:** The `GameLoop` is responsible for ensuring that all events published during a given frame are processed before the next frame begins. It may contain logic to flush the `EventBus` at the end of each `update` cycle.

<hr>

## 9. Player & Interaction Module

### 9.1. Module Responsibility

The **Player & Interaction Module** is responsible for representing the player within the game world as an interactive entity. Its primary function is to bridge the gap between user input and the engine's core systems. It defines the player's physical representation as an **embodied listener** and translates their actions into a meaningful series of events or component updates. This module is the key to providing **player agency** and ensuring that every interaction has a defined, often auditory, consequence. It links the player's input to the engine's feedback systems.

<hr>

### 9.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module introduces two specialized interfaces that define the player's unique role:

#### **`Player` Interface**

The **`Player`** interface extends the base `Entity` interface to represent the player as a special type of object in the world. It is the central container for all player-specific components.

```
interface Player extends Entity {
  input: InputComponent
  listener: AudioListenerComponent
}
```

* **`input` (InputComponent):** A component that holds the state of player actions and inputs (e.g., keyboard presses, mouse movements).
* **`listener` (AudioListenerComponent):** A component that defines the player's auditory perspective in the world. This is a crucial link to the **Audio System Module**.

#### **`InputComponent` Interface**

The **`InputComponent`** is a data-only component that stores the current state of player actions, providing a clean separation between raw input and the systems that process it.

```
interface InputComponent extends Component {
  actions: Map<string, boolean>
}
```

* **`actions` (Map<string, boolean>):** A map where the keys are a predefined set of action names (e.g., "walk_\_forward", "open_\_door") and the values are booleans indicating if the action is currently active.

<hr>

### 9.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The **Player & Interaction Module** is the point of entry for user control, and it sends information to other modules to drive gameplay.

* **Audio System Module:** The `AudioListenerComponent` on the player entity is read by the `AudioSystem` to determine the player's position and orientation, which is essential for sound spatialization. When the player performs an action that should make a sound (like a footstep), the `InputComponent`'s state can be used to trigger an audio event via the **Events & Communication Module**.
* **Events & Communication Module:** The player's input processing system is a major **publisher** of `GameplayEvent`s. For example, if the player presses the "open_\_door" key while near a door entity, the system can publish a `GameplayEvent` of type "door_\_opened" with a payload referencing the door entity. This event is then consumed by other systems.
* **Spatial Definition Module:** The player entity will possess a `TransformComponent` (from the **Spatial Definition Module**). The player's movement and rotation will be applied directly to this component. The `TransformComponent`'s data will then be used by the physics and audio systems.
* **Physics & Interaction Module:** Player movement, when processed, will update the player entity's `TransformComponent`. If the player interacts with an object, the `InputComponent`'s state will be used by an interaction system to check for collisions or triggers (from the **Physics & Interaction Module**) to determine if an action, like "sitting on a bed," is possible.

<hr>
To improve the **Extensibility & Abstraction Module**, we can enhance its design to be more robust and practical. The improvements will focus on incorporating a more explicit factory pattern, adding a mechanism for inheritance and overriding properties, and defining clear interfaces for the editor-facing tools that would use this module.

### Improved Extensibility & Abstraction Module

\<hr\>

### 10.1. Module Responsibility

The **Extensibility & Abstraction Module** serves as the primary interface for content creators, abstracting away the low-level details of the ECS architecture. Its core responsibility is to define a powerful **prefab system** that enables the creation of reusable entity templates. This module allows for **prefab nesting** and **property overrides**, providing a flexible and scalable workflow. It manages the blueprints for entities and their components, ensuring that complex objects can be assembled from simple, reusable parts. This system is the bridge between the engine's code-based architecture and a designer's data-driven workflow.

### 10.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module introduces enhanced interfaces to support a more advanced prefab system:

#### **`Prefab` Interface (Revised)**

The revised `Prefab` interface is a blueprint for creating entities. It now explicitly supports a parent-child relationship, enabling prefab nesting, and includes a mechanism for defining default properties and overrides.

```
interface Prefab {
  name: string
  parent?: Prefab
  components: ComponentDefinition[]
  overrides: Map<string, any>
}
```

* **`name` (string):** A unique identifier for the prefab.
* **`parent` (Prefab?):** An optional reference to another `Prefab`. If present, this prefab inherits all components and properties from its parent.
* **`components` (ComponentDefinition[]):** A list of components to be added to the entity. These are a combination of new components and overrides.
* **`overrides` (Map\<string, any\>):** A map of property keys and their new values. This allows designers to easily change a specific property (e.g., the `mass` of a `PhysicsComponent`) without redefining the entire component, creating a local specialization of the prefab.

#### **`ComponentDefinition` Interface (Revised)**

The `ComponentDefinition` remains a blueprint for a component but is now strictly focused on defining the component type and its default properties.

```
interface ComponentDefinition {
  type: string
  defaultProperties: Map<string, any>
}
```

* **`type` (string):** The string identifier for the type of component to be instantiated.
* **`defaultProperties` (Map\<string, any\>):** A key-value map containing the initial property values for the component instance.

### 10.3. Interactions with Other Modules

The improvements to this module enhance its interactions with the rest of the engine, particularly the core systems and the content pipeline.

* **Resource & Asset Abstraction Module:** The `Prefab` interface is a key data asset managed by this module. The `Resource & Asset Abstraction Module` is responsible for loading the prefab data, which now includes the ability to resolve parent prefabs and apply overrides.
* **Core World & Entities Module:** A new `PrefabInstantiator` system would be added to this module. This system would take a `Prefab` object, recursively resolve its parent prefabs to build a complete list of components, apply any overrides, and then use the `ComponentDefinition`s to create a new `Entity` with all its necessary components. This process ensures that the instantiated entity is a perfect, fully-realized instance of the prefab.
* **Events & Communication Module:** The **Extensibility & Abstraction Module** could publish events such as `"prefab_loaded"` or `"prefab_modified"`, allowing a developer's editor tool or other systems to be notified when a content update occurs.
* **Editor/Tooling:** While not a core engine module, this module is explicitly designed for editor use. The editor's user interface would expose tools to create new prefabs, select parent prefabs, add/remove components, and modify properties, all of which would directly manipulate the data structures defined by this module. This design provides a clear separation between the engine's runtime and the developer's tooling.

## 11. Conceptual Architecture Module

### 11.1. Module Responsibility

The **Conceptual Architecture Module** is a meta-module that describes the high-level, layered structure and data flow of the entire game engine. Its responsibility is not to contain code or interfaces but to document and explain how the other modules relate to and build upon one another. It provides a visual and conceptual map of the engine, ensuring that all designers and engineers understand the dependencies and flow of information from the foundational components up to the user-facing systems. This module serves as the project's architectural guide, promoting clarity and a shared understanding of the engine's design principles.

### 11.2. Component Design & Interfaces

This module has no new interfaces or components of its own. It is a documentation-only module that references all the previously defined interfaces to explain their relationships. Its "components" are the relationships and flow illustrated in the conceptual stack.

### 11.3. Interactions with Other Modules

This module's sole interaction is to describe and visualize the interactions between all other modules.

* **World & Core Entities (Foundation):** The conceptual architecture starts here. It explains that this layer provides the building blocks—`Entity`, `Component`, and `System`—upon which all other layers are built.
* **Spatial Definition:** The architecture shows that this layer, by providing `TransformComponent`s, directly extends the `Component` concept from the foundation, giving entities their location and orientation.
* **Physics & Interaction:** The document explains that this layer uses the `Transform` data from the Spatial layer to perform simulations and then generates events that are passed to the next layer.
* **Events & Communication:** The architecture highlights this as the central nervous system, showing it as the conduit that decouples the Physics and Audio layers.
* **Audio System:** It clarifies that the Audio System consumes data from the Spatial layer and events from the Communication layer to produce sound. It also notes that it relies on assets from the Resource layer and environmental data from the Environment layer.
* **Resource & Asset Abstraction:** This layer is described as a repository that provides the necessary raw data (like audio files and scene definitions) to other systems, such as the Audio and Core World modules.
* **Player & Interaction:** This layer is shown as the interface between the user and the engine, using `InputComponent` to affect the player's `TransformComponent` and generate events.
* **Extensibility & Abstraction:** The conceptual architecture places this at the highest level, explaining that it uses all the lower-level concepts to create a streamlined workflow for developers, allowing them to build complex entities using **Prefabs** and **Composable Design**.
