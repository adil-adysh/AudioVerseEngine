# Game Audio System Design Document

## 1.0 Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and workflow for the game's audio system. The system is designed to provide a high-fidelity, low-latency, and scalable audio experience. It will be built on a modular pipeline consisting of four primary stages: asset management, decoding, processing, and playback. This design ensures separation of concerns, efficient resource management, and a robust framework for complex, dynamic soundscapes.

## 2.0 Architectural Overview

The audio system operates on a dedicated, high-priority thread to decouple audio processing from the main game loop. This prevents performance fluctuations in the core engine from causing audible glitches. The system is composed of four main logical components:

- **Asset & Content Manager**: Loads and manages audio files.
- **Audio Processor & Mixer**: Mixes and applies real-time effects to all active sounds.
- **Source Controllers**: Per-sound objects that manage individual audio streams.
- **Audio Playback Interface**: Streams the final mix to the user's speakers.

## 3.0 Component Breakdown

### 3.1 Asset & Content Manager

This component handles all audio file I/O and data management.

- **Core Technology**: `symphonia` crate for decoding a wide range of audio formats.
- **Functionality**:
  - **File Loading**: Reads compressed audio data from the game's file system or asset bundles.
  - **Caching**: For small, frequently used sound effects (SFX), `symphonia` decodes the entire file into a `Vec<f32>` buffer, which is stored in an in-memory cache for instant access.
  - **Streaming**: For large, linear assets like music or dialogue, it uses `symphonia` to decode and buffer small chunks of data in real-time, preventing high memory usage.
- **Output**: Uncompressed PCM audio samples ready for processing.

### 3.2 Audio Processor & Mixer

This is the central computational component of the audio engine.

- **Core Technology**: A single instance of the `resonance-cxx::Api`.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Source Management**: The `Api` instance is responsible for creating and managing all active sound sources. Each source is a unique audio stream with its own properties.
  - **Real-time Processing**: It receives position and property updates from the main game thread. For each source, it performs:
    - **Spatialization**: Calculates and applies 3D effects based on a source's position relative to the listener, including gain attenuation and panning.
    - **Mixing**: It combines all processed audio streams into a single, cohesive master stream. This is a critical step where sample values are summed together.
  - **Global Effects**: The mixed stream is then passed through a global effects chain, where a primary effect like **reverb** is applied using `resonance-cxx`'s built-in functionality.
- **Output**: A single, processed, and mixed stereo buffer of audio samples.

### 3.3 Source Controllers

These are game-specific objects that bridge the gap between the game state and the audio system.

- **Implementation**: A custom Rust struct or class for each type of sound (e.g., `GunshotSource`, `AmbientMusicSource`).
- **Functionality**:
  - **Instantiation**: Created when a game event triggers a sound. It holds a reference to a `resonance_cxx::SourceId`.
  - **Parameter Update**: It updates the position, velocity, and volume of its corresponding `resonance-cxx` source every frame.
  - **Decoding Integration**: It requests decoded audio chunks from the Asset Manager and feeds them into its associated `resonance-cxx` source.

### 3.4 Audio Playback Interface

This component is responsible for delivering the final audio to the user's hardware.

- **Core Technology**: `audio_backend` crate.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Render Thread**: It launches a high-priority thread to execute the render callback on a strict, real-time schedule.
  - **Buffer Filling**: The render callback retrieves the latest audio buffer from the Audio Processor (`resonance-cxx::Api::fill_interleaved_f32`).
  - **Hardware Output**: It sends this buffer to the operating system's audio API for digital-to-analog conversion and playback. This ensures a low-latency audio experience.

## 4.0 Data Flow Diagram

The pipeline is designed as a unidirectional flow, with data moving from assets to the final audio output.

1.  **Game Event**: A game event (e.g., character movement, explosion) is triggered.
2.  **Audio System**: A `Source Controller` is instantiated and requests the necessary audio data from the Asset Manager.
3.  **Decoding**: The Asset Manager uses `symphonia` to decode the audio asset into a raw audio buffer.
4.  **Processing**: The `Source Controller` feeds this raw audio into the central `resonance-cxx` mixer.
5.  **Mixing**: `resonance-cxx` processes and mixes all active sources into a single, master output buffer.
6.  **Playback**: The `audio_backend`'s render thread requests the master buffer and sends it to the speakers, completing the pipeline.

## 5.0 Notes and Next Steps

- Consider adding diagrams (SVG/PNG) to illustrate threading and buffer lifetimes.
- Add API sketches and example Rust signatures for key interfaces (AssetManager, SourceController, AudioMixer).
- Add tests for the Asset Manager caching and streaming behaviors.
