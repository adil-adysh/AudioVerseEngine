# ðŸŽ§ Audio Engine Header File Analysis (Conceptual Overview)

This document summarizes the relevant details, responsibilities, and design patterns found in the provided header files. The goal is to understand **how the components fit together in an audio game engine**, without Unity- or Rust-specific bias.

---

## 1. **`base/audio_buffer.h`**

### Purpose:

* Defines a **container for audio data**.
* Provides methods for accessing raw channel/sample data.
* Acts as a fundamental unit for **audio processing pipelines**.

### Key Concepts:

* **Channel-based storage** (multichannel support).
* Efficient access to **mutable and immutable samples**.
* Ownership and memory safety (allocation handled by buffer).

### Role in Engine:

* Core data structure passed between DSP (digital signal processing) units.
* Bridges input and output stages (e.g., from microphone â†’ processing â†’ speakers).

---

## 2. **`dsp/gain.h`**

### Purpose:

* Provides **gain control (volume scaling)** for audio signals.
* Common utility in any audio processing chain.

### Key Concepts:

* **Scalar multiplication** of audio samples.
* Operates per-buffer or per-channel.
* Typically lightweight, called often.

### Role in Engine:

* Essential in mixing stages.
* Used for balancing sources, applying fades, or dynamic range adjustments.

---

## 3. **`dsp/channel_converter.h`**

### Purpose:

* Converts audio between different **channel configurations**.
* Example: stereo â†” mono, or arbitrary N-channel mappings.

### Key Concepts:

* Handles **downmixing and upmixing**.
* Preserves perceptual balance when reducing channels.
* Expands audio when targeting multi-speaker setups.

### Role in Engine:

* Crucial when engineâ€™s internal representation differs from device output.
* Enables flexible speaker/headphone rendering.

---

## 4. **`api/resonance_audio_api.h`**

### Purpose:

* Defines the **external API layer** of the engine.
* Provides a **C interface** for external integration (clients, platforms).

### Key Concepts:

* Encapsulates the internal DSP engine.
* Offers functions for creating/destroying engine instances.
* Exposes audio processing entry points.

### Role in Engine:

* Public-facing boundary.
* Decouples engine internals from host application.

---

## 5. **`platforms/unity/unity_nativeaudioplugins.h`**

### Purpose:

* Defines **Unity-specific glue callbacks** to integrate the engine as a Unity plugin.

### Key Concepts:

* **Lifecycle callbacks** (create, release).
* **Processing callbacks** (buffer in â†’ process â†’ buffer out).
* **Spatializer hooks** (distance attenuation, parameters).
* **Effect registration** with Unityâ€™s audio subsystem.

### Role in Engine:

* Not essential for the engineâ€™s DSP core.
* Provides an **integration pattern**: how an external system interacts with the engine (via callbacks, parameter queries, buffer hooks).

# ðŸ”‘ Cross-File Insights

1. **Layered Architecture**

   * **DSP primitives**: `gain.h`, `channel_converter.h`
   * **Data container**: `audio_buffer.h`
   * **API surface**: `resonance_audio_api.h`
   * **Platform integration**: `unity_nativeaudioplugins.h`

2. **Core Processing Flow**

   * Audio source (input buffer) â†’ DSP units (gain, channel conversion, spatialization) â†’ Output buffer (to speakers or host system).

3. **Design Patterns**

   * **Callback-driven processing** (esp. Unity integration).
   * **Opaque handles & C API** for external usage.
   * **Composable DSP building blocks** (gain, conversion, spatialization).
   * **Engine as middleware** between host platform and raw DSP.

# ðŸ§© Why This Matters for an Audio Game Engine

* The **engine is modular**:

  * Data container (buffer).
  * DSP effects (gain, conversion).
  * API (engine boundary).
  * Platform bindings (integration layer).

* The **.h files show separation of concerns**:

  * Low-level DSP doesnâ€™t know about Unity, APIs, or external systems.
  * High-level APIs wrap and expose these DSP blocks.

* The **architecture is portable**:

  * By swapping out `unity_nativeaudioplugins.h`, the engine could integrate with another platform (like a custom engine or middleware).

âœ… This gives us a **blueprint** of how the audio game engine is structured in C++.
We now clearly see which parts are **engine core** vs. **integration glue**.
