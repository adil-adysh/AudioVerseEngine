### **üéß High-Level Concepts for Audio Game Engine (Refined with Interfaces)**

#### **1. Core World & Entities**

  * **Entity**: Represents anything in the world (player, door, bed, table, ambience source).
  * **Component**: Defines aspects of an entity (position, orientation, audio source, physical properties).
  * **System**: Processes entities that share components (physics, audio, interaction).
  * **Scene / World**: Collection of entities and systems forming a playable space.

Interfaces:

```
interface Entity {
  id: string
  components: Component[]
}

interface Component {
  type: string
  properties: Map<string, any>
}

interface System {
  update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number): void
}

interface Scene {
  entities: Entity[]
  systems: System[]
}
```

#### **2. Spatial Definition**

  * **Transform**: Position, orientation, and scale in 3D space.
  * **Hierarchy**: Entities can be grouped (e.g., table in room, door attached to wall).
  * **Bounding Volumes**: Used for space awareness and grouping (room boundaries, zones).

Interfaces:

```
interface TransformComponent extends Component {
  position: Vec3
  rotation: Quat
  scale: Vec3
}

interface SpatialHierarchy {
  parent?: Entity
  children: Entity[]
}
```

#### **3. Physics & Interaction**

  * **Collisions**: Physical contact between objects (table bump, footstep on floor).
  * **Materials**: Defines surface type (wood, metal, glass) for interaction feedback.
  * **Triggers**: Zones or states that activate events (entering room, opening door).
  * **Dynamics**: Movement, mass, forces shaping how objects behave in the world.

Interfaces:

```
interface PhysicsComponent extends Component {
  mass: number
  material: string
  isTrigger: boolean
}

interface CollisionEvent {
  entityA: Entity
  entityB: Entity
  contactPoint: Vec3
}
```

#### **4. Audio System**

  * **Listener**: Represents the player‚Äôs auditory perspective.
  * **Audio Sources**: Emit sounds (door creak, bed impact, table knock).
  * **Spatialization**: Perception of sound in 3D space (position, distance, direction).
  * **Room Acoustics**: Defines reverb, absorption, reflection characteristics of a space.
  * **Sound Propagation**: Occlusion, diffraction, attenuation.

Interfaces:

```
interface AudioListenerComponent extends Component {
  orientation: Quat
  position: Vec3
}

interface AudioSourceComponent extends Component {
  soundAsset: string
  loop: boolean
  volume: number
  spatialized: boolean
}
```

#### **5. Events & Communication**

  * **Physics Events**: From collisions, triggers, dynamics.
  * **Gameplay Events**: Semantic actions (door opened, bed sat on, object dropped).
  * **Audio Events**: Requests to play, stop, or modify sounds.
  * **Event Flow**: Decoupled communication between systems and components.

Interfaces:

```
interface Event {
  type: string
  payload: any
}

interface EventBus {
  publish(event: Event): void
  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: (event: Event) => void): void
}
```

#### **6. Resource & Asset Abstraction**

  * **Audio Assets**: Sound files for effects, ambience, music.
  * **Metadata**: Mapping between events and sounds.
  * **Categories**: Grouping of sounds (SFX, music, ambience, UI).
  * **Scene Definitions**: High-level description of spaces, entities, and relationships.

Interfaces:

```
interface Asset {
  id: string
  type: string
  path: string
}

interface AudioAsset extends Asset {
  category: string
}

interface SceneDefinition {
  entities: Entity[]
  prefabs: Prefab[]
}
```

#### **7. Environment & Rooms**

  * **Room Boundaries**: Define spatial zones (bedroom, hallway, outdoor area).
  * **Transitions**: Moving between spaces (open door ‚Üí new acoustic space).
  * **Environmental Effects**: Each room has unique acoustic identity (small room echo, outdoor openness).

Interfaces:

```
interface Room {
  id: string
  bounds: BoundingVolume
  acousticProfile: AcousticProfile
}

interface AcousticProfile {
  reverb: number
  absorption: number
  reflections: number
}
```

#### **8. Runtime & Flow**

  * **Time & Scheduling**: Concept of global game time.
  * **Update Loop**: Continuous cycle of updates (physics, events, audio, gameplay).
  * **Synchronization**: Keeps systems aligned (physics ‚Üî audio).

Interfaces:

```
interface Time {
  deltaTime: number
  currentTime: number
}

interface GameLoop {
  update(time: Time): void
}
```

#### **9. Player & Interaction Concept**

  * **Embodied Listener**: Player exists as an entity with position/orientation.
  * **Agency**: Player interacts with objects (open door, move chair, walk on floor).
  * **Feedback**: Every interaction has auditory consequence.

Interfaces:

```
interface Player extends Entity {
  input: InputComponent
  listener: AudioListenerComponent
}

interface InputComponent extends Component {
  actions: Map<string, boolean>
}
```

#### **10. Extensibility & Abstraction**

  * **Prefabs / Templates**: Conceptual blueprints for common objects (door, bed, table).
  * **Composable Design**: Complex entities built from reusable components.
  * **Scalability**: World expands from single room ‚Üí building ‚Üí outdoor scene.

Interfaces:

```
interface Prefab {
  name: string
  components: ComponentDefinition[]
}

interface ComponentDefinition {
  type: string
  defaultProperties: Map<string, any>
}
```

#### **11. Conceptual Architecture**

The engine's conceptual architecture can be visualized as a layered stack, with each layer building upon the one below it. This structure demonstrates the flow of data and dependencies from the foundational world concepts up to the player-facing interactions.

-----

**Conceptual Stack:**

**World & Core Entities** (Foundation)

  * Defines the root container (`Scene`) and the building blocks (`Entity`, `Component`, `System`).

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Spatial Definition**

  * Provides the physical location and hierarchy for all entities in the world (`Transform`, `SpatialHierarchy`).

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Physics & Interaction**

  * Simulates physical properties and interactions (`Collision`, `Triggers`, `Dynamics`). It operates on the entities defined in the Spatial layer and produces events.

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Events & Communication**

  * Provides a decoupled mechanism for systems to communicate (`EventBus`). It is the conduit for all interactions, including physics-to-audio events.

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Audio System**

  * Renders the sound world based on data from the Physics and Spatial layers, creating the core audio experience (`Listener`, `AudioSource`, `RoomAcoustics`).

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Resource & Asset Abstraction**

  * Manages the raw assets (audio files, scene definitions) and their metadata, which are used to build the world and its sounds.

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Player & Interaction**

  * Represents the player as an embodied entity with input capabilities. This layer brings together the `Listener` and `InputComponent` to enable player agency within the simulated world.

‚¨áÔ∏è

**Extensibility & Abstraction** (Highest Layer)

  * The top layer, focused on developer-facing tools and design patterns (`Prefabs`, `Composable Design`), which enable the creation of content using the layers below.
