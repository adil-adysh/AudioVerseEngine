# audio-system crate

Minimal audio system crate for AudioVerseEngine. Uses `oddio` for audio graph and playback. This crate provides a small `AudioSystem` type with placeholder APIs for initialization, starting/stopping playback, and per-frame updates.

This is scaffolding derived from `docs/audio-game-engine.md` and will be expanded to integrate the engine's ECS, mixer, and Resonance Audio spatialization.
